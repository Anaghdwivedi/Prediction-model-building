# Prediction-model-building
In this repository I build some models using diffrent concepts of 'ML' like 'ONE HOT ENCODER',
'XGBOOST','PIPELINE','LINEAR REGRESSION' and using other things like 
'NUMPY','PANDAS','SKLEARN','MATPLOTLIB' and also calculating its
accuracy by the help of 'MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR' concept.
